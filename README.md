📊 Data Analysis Overview 📈

To provide insightful data analysis on various datasets covering different domains. Through advanced techniques and methodologies, we uncover patterns, correlations, and trends within the data, leading to valuable insights.

## Dataset Characteristics 📋

- The dataset contains categorical columns with three categories labeled as 0, 1, and 2, representing different classifications based on independent features.

### Frequencies within the dataset are as follows:

- Category 0: 0.33
- Category 1: 0.398
- Category 2: 0.269

## Correlation Analysis 📈

Through graphical representations and Pearson correlation analysis, we observe the following correlations between Height and Size for both Male and Female categories:

Positive linear correlation of 0.77 for Male
Positive linear correlation of 0.70 for Female

## Feature Reduction with PCA 🧮

Analyzing the Wine dataset, consisting of 13 features, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality to 2 dimensions and separate into 3 distinct classes.

- PCA enhances class variance and provides clearer boundaries between classes.
- Standardization of the dataset reduces data point means, aiding in clearer class separation.
- Post-standardization, distinct boundaries are visible in the graphs, eliminating overlaps between classes.

## Distance Matrix Analysis 🔍

Exploring the distance matrix in Lab 3, we uncover insightful information regarding student clusters based on parental educational attainment:

- Students with parents who completed some high school exhibit higher average distances compared to those with parents who completed a master’s degree.
- Heatmap matrix organization reveals distinct student groupings based on parental education levels, indicating significant differences in student characteristics.
- The heatmap matrix offers valuable insights into relationships between student clusters, emphasizing socioeconomic and educational disparities.
